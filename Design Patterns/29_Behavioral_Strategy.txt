## Strategy Design Pattern

- It allows to specify the behaviour of the class partially and to choose particular algorithm from a family of algorithms. 

- Strategy Design Pattern enables the exact behaviour of a system to become selective either at compile time or run time.

- It’s easy to switch between different algorithms(strategies) in runtime.

- Separate the concerns into classes --> a class to each strategy (Single Responsibility & Open-Closed Principle)

- When should we use Strategy Design Pattern?
  - to use several algorithms with different variations
  – When there are conditional statements around several related algorithms.
