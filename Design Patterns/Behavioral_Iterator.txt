Iterator Design Pattern
-	In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements.
-	The simplest iterators provide for unidirectional traversal of elements with no changes allowed to the underlying data structure.
-	More complex iterators allow for bidirectional traversal and/or permit elements to be added to or removed from the underlying data structure.
-	They all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.
