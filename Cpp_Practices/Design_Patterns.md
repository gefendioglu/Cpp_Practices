## DESIGN PATTERNS

- Design patterns are guidelines for identifying and solving common design problems in object-oriented programming.
- There are 23 fundamental design patterns. These patterns are grouped into three basic categories: creational, behavioral, and structural.
- The main reason is that they provide best practices solutions to common software design problems based on the collected wisdom of many programmers.
- The second reason is that design patterns provide a concise vocabulary for discussing design problems and their solutions. 
- The wrong design pattern can add unnecessary complexity to an application, and an incorrect or inefficient implementation of a pattern can introduce bugs or compromise performance.
- Some work has also been done to identify patterns that should not be used. These “anti-patterns” are common pitfalls or improper practices that lead to inefficient, ineffective, difficult-to-understand, or difficult-to-maintain code.
